UK Crop Yield Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project that explores the impact of key environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature, on crop yield in the United Kingdom. The data was sourced from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Met Office National Climate Information Centre.

Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard visualizes the correlation between climate factors—annual mean temperature and rainfall—and crop production (including wheat, barley, and cereal) in the UK. It offers insights into how these factors influence crop yield over time, allowing for a detailed year-by-year comparison.

Features
Annual Mean Temperature by Year: A line graph that shows the fluctuation in annual mean temperature from 1900 to the present.
Annual Rainfall by Year: A line graph representing the total annual rainfall over the years, highlighting significant wet and dry periods.
Crop Production by Year: A bar graph displaying the volume of harvested crop production (in thousand tonnes), segmented by different crop types (wheat, barley, cereal) from 1990 onwards.
Environmental Impact on Crop Production: A combined analysis showing how variations in annual rainfall and temperature affect the production of key crops in the UK.
Data Sources
Crop Yield Data: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
Rainfall and Temperature Data: Met Office National Climate Information Centre
Data Cleaning
To prepare the data for analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed:

Handling Missing Data: Missing values were addressed through interpolation and appropriate imputation techniques.
Data Standardization: Ensured that all data were on the same time scale and unit of measurement for meaningful analysis.
Outlier Identification: Detected and managed outliers to maintain the integrity of the visualizations.
Formatting: Renamed columns and standardized date formats for better readability and consistency.
Tools Used
Power BI: For creating the visualizations and interactive dashboard.
Excel/Power Query: For initial data cleaning and transformation.
Dashboard Highlights
Annual Mean Temperature vs. Crop Yield: Displays trends in temperature and their potential impact on agricultural output.
Annual Rainfall vs. Crop Yield: Shows the relationship between rainfall and crop production.
Crop Production Over Time: Illustrates the production of key crops (wheat, barley, cereal) over the years.
